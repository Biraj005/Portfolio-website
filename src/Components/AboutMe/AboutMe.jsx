            <p>
              I'm a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student at JGEC, deeply interested in full-stack development, competitive programming, and machine learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love building things with C++, React, and Node.js, and I'm constantly exploring new technologies. When I'm not coding, you'll find me reading tech blogs or solving algorithmic problems.
